<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3 pounds ground beef</li>
  <li>25 saltine crackers, crushed</li>
  <li>1 cup milk</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
  <li>3 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
  <li>1 (8 ounce) can mushrooms, drained (Optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
  <li>
    Mix ground beef, crackers, milk, pepper, salt, garlic powder, and Italian
    seasoning together in a large bowl until well combined. Form into eight
    large patties and place into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour condensed soup
    evenly over patties, then sprinkle canned mushrooms over top. Cover the pan
    with a lid or aluminum foil.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bake in the preheated oven until patties are no longer pink in the center,
    about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
    should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
