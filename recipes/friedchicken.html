  I experimented with lots of recipes over the years to find the best crispy
  fried chicken. This is it! It's bits and pieces of hints I have heard over the
  years. It's more a matter of preparation and cooking method!
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>30 saltine crackers</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons dry potato flakes</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
  <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Place crackers in a large resealable plastic bag; seal bag and crush
    crackers with a rolling pin until they are coarse crumbs. Add the flour,
    potato flakes, seasoned salt, and pepper and mix well.
  </li>
  <li>
    Beat egg in a shallow dish or bowl. One by one, dredge chicken pieces in
    egg, then place in bag with crumb mixture. Seal bag and shake to coat.
  </li>
  <li>
    Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
  </li>
  <li>
    Fry chicken, turning frequently, until golden brown and juices run clear, 15
    to 20 minutes.
  </li>
</ol>
